# RNAseq

These are the materials used for the RNAseq course given as part of the Smithsonian-Mason School of Conservation [Bioinformatics Analysis for Conservation Genomics](https://smconservation.gmu.edu/programs/graduate-and-professional/bioinformatics-analysis-for-conservation-genomics/) on October 17th 2019. 

**Note: This tutorial has been updated and modified from the Trinity tutorial given by Brian Haas [here](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/KrumlovTrinityWorkshopJan2016/wiki/Home/e67c7a4ae4fe005866a56371ea29f15c79e8ccfb) for use on the Smithsonian HPC. We will also use data from [Defining the transcriptomic landscape of Candida glabrata by RNA-Seq](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25586221). We are very grateful that these materials have been made public by the Trinity team!**
