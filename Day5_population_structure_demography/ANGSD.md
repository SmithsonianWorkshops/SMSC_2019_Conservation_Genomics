## ANGSD

Now that we have the bam files from yesterday, we are going to run [ANGSD](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD). ANGSD can perform a variety of population genomics analyses. Today, we are going to use it to look at population structure and to estimate an allele frequency spectrum (or site frequency spectrum).
